Below is the **spoken voice**, as if you are presenting it live.
Natural, direct, slightly provocative.
Not reading slides. Talking to people.

---

### Slide 1 – Title

“Total disruption sounds dramatic, I know.
But I genuinely believe we are massively underestimating what’s happening right now.
And not in five or ten years. Already.”

---

### Slide 2 – The Common Mental Model of AI

“When I ask people what AI is, most answers are basically the same.
It’s a chatbot.
You open it, ask something, get an answer, close it again.

That feels harmless.
Contained.
Optional.”

---

### Slide 3 – Why People Feel Safe

“And honestly, the world seems to confirm that view.

No big layoffs.
No visible productivity shock.
Daily life feels the same.

There are even studies saying AI hasn’t changed the economy much yet.
So the conclusion is: probably overhyped.”

---

### Slide 4 – The Hidden Shift

“But that conclusion is wrong.

Not because of chatbots.
Chatbots are not the story.

The story is agents.”

---

### Slide 5 – What an Agent Actually Is

“At first glance, an agent looks trivial.
It’s just an LLM in a loop.

But that loop is everything.

Because now the model can think, act, observe, and think again.
Continuously.
With tools.”

---

### Slide 6 – Agents Can Do Human Computer Work

“An agent can do everything a human does on a computer.

It can open files.
Write files.
Browse the web.
Use websites.
Query databases.
Tail log files.

Same actions as us.
Just faster.
And without getting tired.”

---

### Slide 7 – The Key Realization

“And that leads to the key realization.

Agents are not tools.
They are workers.

Always on.
Extremely cheap.
And increasingly reliable.”

---

### Slide 8 – Humans vs Agents: Where the Line Is

“This puts agents in direct competition with humans who work on a computer.

Anything that is sequential, predefined, process-driven
will be automated.

But creative work is different.
That doesn’t disappear.
It gets massively boosted.”

---

### Slide 9 – Development as the First Shockwave

“Software development is just the first place where this becomes obvious.

With a capable coding agent, development can easily be ten times faster.
Not five percent.
Not twenty percent.

An order of magnitude.”

---

### Slide 10 – Proof: What Industry Leaders Are Saying

“And this is not just my opinion.

People who built the modern software industry are saying this openly.

Ryan Dahl says the era of humans writing code is over.
DHH says the speed-up is undeniable.
Sam Altman says it’s hard to imagine where this will be by the end of the year.

These are not hype accounts on Twitter.
These are builders.”

---

### Slide 11 – Signals in the Ecosystem

“And you can already see weak signals.

Attention is shifting.
Even before the real impact hits.

This usually happens right before a bigger wave follows.”

---

### Slide 12 – This Is Not Just a Tech Question

“So this is not a tech question.

It’s a personal question.
And it’s a company question.

What do *you* do with this?
What does *your organization* do with this?”

---

### Slide 13 – The Wrong Reaction

“The wrong reaction is to ignore it.
Or delay it.
Or hope it stabilizes.

That has never worked with exponential technology.”

---

### Slide 14 – The Only Viable Strategy

“The only strategy that makes sense is simple, but uncomfortable.

Learn it.
Master it.
Leverage it.
Use it for your own advantage.”

---

### Slide 15 – What This Means in Practice

“And this has consequences.

Some work simply does not make sense anymore.

There is no point in doing something
that an agent can do better, faster, and cheaper.”

---

### Slide 16 – Why We Start With Coding

“We start with coding not because it ends there.

But because it’s the easiest place to learn how agents really work.

Once you understand that, your perspective changes everywhere.”

---

### Slide 17 – Workshop Transition

“So tomorrow, we’ll get practical.

I’ll show you how to actually use coding agents
in a way that gives *you* leverage.

Not theory.
Not demos.
Real workflows.”

---

### Slide 18 – Closing

“And I’ll end with this.

You can’t stop it.
You can master it.”

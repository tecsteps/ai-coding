# 15-Minute Pitch: Glimpse of the Future
## Target: Company just starting with AI coding

---

# Original Draft (for reference)

Total disruption. We're living in a world where disruption is happening at an unbelievable fast pace. And most people,
including developers and all the politicians, are not aware.They think AI is something, is a chatbot that you can open,
you can use to fetch some information, and you close it, and that's it. Not dangerous. Also, there are studies that say
that AI did not change the economy much. No visible jumps in the cost, no big layoffs because of AI. Most people's lives
is totally unaffected. But that perception is wrong. Why is it wrong? There is a new technology with exponential
progress, AI agents.Agents look very harmless. It's an LLM in a loop, that is, not dangerous. Welcome to the era of
agents. But actually, an agent is pretty close to a living organism. When running on a computer, it can do everything a
human can do. Open files, write files, web searches, use websites, query databases, Tail log files. And it's doing it
with light speed, reliability, and human-level intelligence.And that has consequences. Agents are in direct competition
to humans who work on a computer. Jobs that are sequential and predefined will be fully automated and taken over by
agents. Or replace the word jobs with activities. Activities that are creative will be massively boosted. For instance,
development with a capable coding agent can easily be ten times faster than everything we knew before. The question is,
how we deal with this? That's a question that every company and also every individual Has to ask itself. My
recommendation is to not ignore it. To learn it, master it, leverage it, become good at it. Use it for your own
advantage. Business models need to be adjusted. Some work simply does not make sense anymore. Tasks need to be changed.
There is no point in doing something that an agent could do better and for a fraction of the cost. So in the workshop
tomorrow, I will show you how to use coding agents to your own advantage. This is the beginning of a long journey and
does not stop in coding. Everybody should look at your agents and open your mind. When you can stop it, master it.

## Slide 1: Title

**Content:**
"The Future of Software Development"
Subtitle: How AI Coding Agents are Changing Everything

**Show:** Clean title, maybe subtle tech animation

---

## Slide 2: About Me

**Content:**
Fabian Wesner
CTO & Entrepreneur

- Solopreneur & AI-Coding Coach
- Tech Co-Founder of Spryker and ROQ
- CTO of Rocket Internet and Project A

**Show:** Photo, LinkedIn link

## Slide 3: The Disruption is Here

**Tell them:**
"We're living in a world where disruption happens at an unbelievable pace. Most people - including developers and politicians - are not aware. They think AI is just a chatbot you open, ask a question, and close."

"Studies say AI hasn't changed the economy much. No visible jumps, no big layoffs. Most people's lives are totally unaffected."

"But that perception is wrong."

**Show:** Split visual - "What people think" vs "What's actually happening"

---

## Slide 4: StackOverflow is Dying

**Tell them:**
"For 15 years, StackOverflow was THE place developers went for answers. Look what happened."

**Show:** Chart from stackoverflow_usage.csv
- Peak: ~300k questions/month (2017-2020)
- Today: ~3,500 questions/month (Jan 2026)
- That's a 99% drop!

**Key insight:** "Developers stopped asking humans for help. They're asking AI."

---

## Slide 5: The Industry Leaders Have Spoken

**Tell them:**
"This isn't just hype. The people who built the tools we all use are saying this is real."

**Show:** Grid with photos and quotes from:
- Ryan Dahl (Node.js creator) - ryan_dahl.png
- DHH (Rails creator) - dhh.png
- Uncle Bob (Clean Code) - uncle.png

---

## Slide 6: What are Coding Agents?

**Tell them:**
"An LLM in a loop - sounds harmless, right? But an agent is pretty close to a living organism. When running on a computer, it can do everything a human can do."

**Show:** (animated reveal)
- Open and write files
- Web searches
- Use websites
- Query databases
- Read log files
- Run commands

"And it does it with light speed, reliability, and human-level intelligence."

---

## Slide 7: The Evolution of Development

**Tell them:**
"Here's where we've been and where we're going."

**Show:** Evolution timeline (reuse existing slide type)
- 1x - Developer writes code (IDE)
- 1.3x - Developer writes code with AI (Tab completion)
- 10x - AI writes code with developer (Coding agents) <- HIGHLIGHT: "We are here"
- Infinity - AI writes code independently (Fully autonomous)

---

## Slide 8: Google Trends - Claude Code

**Tell them:**
"Claude Code is the leading coding agent right now. Look at the adoption curve."

**Show:** Google Trends graph with timeline markers:
- Feb 2024: Public Preview
- Oct 2024: V1 Release
- Jan 2025: Opus 4.5

Exponential growth visible.

---

## Slide 9: We Are Early Adopters

**Tell them:**
"Where are we on the technology adoption curve? Still in early adopter territory. You have a window of opportunity."

**Show:** Classic adoption curve:
- Innovators (2.5%)
- Early Adopters (13.5%) <- "Claude Code is here"
- Early Majority (34%)
- Late Majority (34%)
- Laggards (16%)

---

## Slide 10: The Productivity Curve

**Tell them:**
"This is just the beginning. We're at the very start of an exponential curve."

**Show:** Graph
- X-axis: Time (2023 -> Future)
- Y-axis: Productivity
- Exponential curve going up
- Marker: "You are here" at the foot of the curve

"The upside from here is massive."

---

## Slide 11: Consequences

**Tell them:**
"Agents are in direct competition with humans who work on computers. This creates two paths."

**Show:** Split view

**Path 1 - Sequential & Predefined Work:**
-> Will be fully automated
-> Taken over by agents
(Show as inevitable, neutral)

**Path 2 - Creative Work:**
-> Massively boosted
-> 10x faster development
-> Competitive advantage
(Show as opportunity)

---

## Slide 12: The Question Every Company Must Ask

**Tell them:**
"How do we deal with this? That's the question every company - and every individual - has to ask."

**Show:** Two options

Option 1: Ignore it
(crossed out or dimmed)

Option 2: Learn it. Master it. Leverage it.
(highlighted)

"Business models need adjusting. Some work simply doesn't make sense anymore. There's no point doing something an agent could do better and for a fraction of the cost."

---

## Slide 13: What It Looks Like in Practice (Quick Demo)

**Tell them:**
"Let me show you what this actually looks like."

**Show:** Brief demo or GIF of:
- A simple prompt being entered
- The agent working (tools, thinking)
- The result appearing

"This is not science fiction. This is today."

---

## Slide 14: Getting Started is Easy... But

**Tell them:**
"Getting started is easy. You can install Claude Code in 5 minutes. But doing it RIGHT - that's where the skill comes in."

**Show:**
Simple prompt: "Change the button color to green"

Then reveal the three pillars:
1. Spec-Driven Development
2. Knowledge & Guardrails
3. Tools & MCPs

"These are the patterns that separate 2x from 10x productivity."

## Slide 15: Call to Action

**Tell them:**
"The window is open. The early adopters are moving. In 2 years, this will be table stakes. The question is: will you be ahead or behind?"

**Show:**
"The window is open."
